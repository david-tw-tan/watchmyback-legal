## Common Questions

### App Functionality

**Q: How does WatchMyBack work?**
A: WatchMyBack uses your device's camera and advanced pose detection to monitor your posture in real-time. When you slouch or lean forward beyond your calibrated threshold, the app alerts you with customizable audio notifications to help you maintain good posture.

**Q: How do I calibrate the app?**
A: When you first start a monitoring session, you'll go through a quick calibration process. Position yourself in your ideal sitting posture, and the app will use this as your baseline. The app will then monitor any deviation from this posture.

**Q: What are the different alert levels?**
A: WatchMyBack has three alert levels that trigger based on how long you've been slouching:
- **Level 1:** Initial gentle reminder after short slouching
- **Level 2:** More persistent alert if slouching continues
- **Level 3:** Strongest alert for prolonged poor posture

You can customize the timing and sounds for each level in Settings.

**Q: Can I use the app while on video calls?**
A: Yes! WatchMyBack runs in the background during video calls. However, since both apps need camera access, you may need to grant WatchMyBack permission to use the camera while other apps are active (iOS 16+).

**Q: Does the app work in landscape mode?**
A: WatchMyBack is optimized for portrait mode monitoring. For best results, keep your device in portrait orientation during monitoring sessions.

**Q: Can I track my posture history?**
A: Yes! The app includes a Session History feature where you can view your past monitoring sessions, including duration, alert counts, and posture quality over time.

**Q: How long can I run a monitoring session?**
A: You can run monitoring sessions for as long as you need. The app is designed to work efficiently during extended work sessions without draining your battery excessively.

### Camera and Permissions

**Q: Why does the app need camera access?**
A: WatchMyBack requires camera access to monitor your posture using pose detection technology. The camera feed is processed locally on your device and is never recorded or transmitted.

**Q: Is my camera feed recorded or saved?**
A: No. The camera is used only for real-time pose detection. No video or images are ever saved, stored, or transmitted anywhere. Your privacy is fully protected.

**Q: The camera preview isn't showing. What should I do?**
A: Make sure you've granted camera permissions to WatchMyBack. Go to iPhone Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → WatchMyBack and enable access. If it's already enabled, try restarting the app.

**Q: Can I use the app without showing the camera preview?**
A: The camera is required for pose detection, but you can minimize or background the app during monitoring. The pose detection continues to work even when the app is not in the foreground.

### Audio and Alerts

**Q: How do I customize alert sounds?**
A: Go to Settings → Alert Settings. You can choose from different alert sounds, adjust volume levels, and customize the timing for each alert level.

**Q: The alerts aren't playing. What's wrong?**
A: Check that:
- Your device is not on silent mode
- Volume is turned up
- Alert settings are properly configured in the app
- You've granted audio permissions to the app

**Q: Can I test the alert sounds?**
A: Yes! In Settings → Alert Settings, you'll find a sound test feature where you can preview all alert levels before starting a monitoring session.

**Q: The app supports multiple languages?**
A: Yes! WatchMyBack is localized in 17 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, and more. TTS alerts are also available in all supported languages.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The app crashes or freezes. What can I do?**
A: Try force-closing the app and restarting it. If the issue persists, try restarting your device. If problems continue, contact support with details about when the crash occurs.

**Q: Pose detection isn't working properly.**
A: Ensure:
- Your device is positioned where it has a clear view of your upper body
- The room has adequate lighting
- The camera lens is clean and unobstructed
- You've completed the calibration process properly

Try recalibrating in your current lighting conditions for best results.

**Q: The app is draining my battery.**
A: Pose detection is a resource-intensive process. To minimize battery drain:
- Use your device while plugged in during long sessions
- Lower screen brightness
- Close unnecessary background apps
- Enable Low Power Mode if needed (though this may affect performance)

### Privacy and Data

**Q: What data do you collect?**
A: WatchMyBack collects minimal data, all stored locally on your device. Session history (duration, alert counts) is saved locally only. No camera data, personal information, or usage data is ever transmitted off your device.

**Q: Is the camera feed processed on my device or in the cloud?**
A: All pose detection happens locally on your device using Apple's Vision framework. No camera data is ever sent to any servers or cloud services.

**Q: Can anyone access my camera feed?**
A: No. Only the WatchMyBack app has access to the camera feed during monitoring, and it's processed entirely on your device. Nothing is recorded, saved, or transmitted.

**Q: What happens to my session history if I delete the app?**
A: Your session history is stored locally on your device. If you delete the app, all your data will be deleted with it. There are no cloud backups.
